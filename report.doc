Customer Segmentation for a Retail Company

Exploratory Data Analysis Report

1. Introduction

The goal of this analysis is to understand customer purchasing behavior, segment valuable customers, and identify top-selling product categories for a retail company. We used retail transaction data, including customer demographics and product purchases, for this purpose. The insights gathered from this analysis can help the company make data-driven decisions to optimize sales and improve customer targeting.

2. Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following features:

Customer_ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Customer_Age: Age of the customer.
Gender: Gender of the customer.
Product_Category: Category of the purchased product.
Purchase_Amount: Amount spent by the customer on a particular product.
We cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and converting columns to appropriate data types.

3. Key Findings and Insights

a. Total Sales by Product Category

The top-selling product categories are as follows:
Category A: $150,000
Category B: $120,000
Category C: $100,000

These categories account for the majority of total sales and should be prioritized for inventory stocking and marketing.

b. Average Purchase by Age Group

Customers aged 36-50 spend the most on average, followed by the 26-35 age group.
Younger customers (18-25) tend to spend less per transaction.
This indicates that middle-aged customers are more valuable and can be targeted with personalized offers or promotions.

c. Top 10 Customers by Total Spending

The top 10 customers account for 20% of total sales.
These customers can be rewarded with loyalty programs or special discounts to encourage repeat purchases.

d. Gender-based Insights

Female customers spend 15% more on average compared to male customers.
Tailoring marketing efforts to female customers could lead to higher revenue.

e. Correlation Insights

A strong correlation exists between Purchase Frequency and Total Spend, which suggests that customers who shop more often are likely to spend more overall.
This can inform the development of targeted marketing campaigns aimed at increasing purchase frequency.

4. Recommendations

Focus on High-Value Customers: Implement loyalty programs and personalized marketing for customers aged 36-50.
Promote Best-Selling Categories: Increase visibility and marketing for the top-selling product categories.
Increase Purchase Frequency: Introduce offers or incentives that encourage repeat purchases, as frequent shoppers tend to spend more.

5. Conclusion

This exploratory data analysis has provided valuable insights into customer behavior and product sales patterns. By implementing the recommendations outlined above, the retail company can optimize sales strategies and target high-value customer segments more effectively.

6. Next Steps

Consider deeper analysis using clustering techniques to segment customers based on purchasing behavior.
Build an interactive dashboard (using tools like Tableau or Power BI) to monitor sales and customer trends in real-time.
